I am a Data Analyst with a Masters in Data Science. My interests lie in working on product data science roles that would allow me to improve business functions and/or enhance customer experience and achieve business goals. I enjoy transforming messy data to organizational gold and want to make the process as simple, accessible and easily understandabe for all.
