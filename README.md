Hi, I'm Sneha! 
I am a Data Science graduate/ Data Analyst. I enjoy working with messy data to generate more meaning from it. 
My main focus as a data professional is to make data accessible and understandable for all. I am able to achieve that by:
- Using my skills in Python, SQL, Tableau to actually clean, analyze and visually present insights I find along the way
- Writing blogs every now and then about topics in the Data and Tech space (refer to my medium blog) to stay informed and keep informed
